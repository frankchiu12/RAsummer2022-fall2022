2/2/05,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 21/4 percent. The Committee's policy actions since mid2004 have materially reduced the degree of monetary policy accommodation. The Committee believes that the stance of monetary policy remains somewhat accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions seem to be improving gradually. Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to promote price stability and sustainable growth.",A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Although month-to-month movements in inflation have been volatile of late, underlying inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained. The Committee perceives that, if the current target for the federal funds rate were maintained for the next few quarters, it is more likely than not that output would grow at a pace faster than is sustainable and that inflation pressures would pick up.

3/28/06,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 4 1/2 percent. The slowing of the growth of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 seems largely to have reflected temporary or special factors. Economic growth has rebounded in the current quarter, and the underlying pace of expansion appears to be solid. Resource utilization has risen further this year. Some recent data and anecdotal information suggest that the housing market is moderating, which the Committee believes will contribute to a slowing in economic growth to a more sustainable pace. In addition to increases in resource utilization, the elevated prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to add to inflation pressures going forward. As yet, however, the run-up in those prices has had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains have held the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remain contained.

The Committee also is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets. The Federal Reserve has launched the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses and anticipates that the range of eligible collateral for this facility is likely to be expanded to include other financial assets. The Committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments and to assess whether lending facilities should be expanded or modified to provide further support to credit markets and economic activity and to help preserve price stability.",B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3/18/09,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. Information received since the Committee met in January indicates that the economy has slowed further. Job losses, declining equity and housing wealth, and tight credit conditions have weighed on consumer sentiment and spending. Weaker sales prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories and fixed investment. Furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly. Conditions in some financial markets have improved, in part reflecting government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen financial institutions. The Committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic activity will begin later this year, but the downside risks to that outlook are significant. In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities that occurred last fall and the prospects for considerable economic slack, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued in coming quarters before returning to rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term. The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability. The Federal Reserve continues to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand the quantity of such purchases and the duration of the purchase program as conditions warrant. The Committee also is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets.

4/29/09,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the economy continues to contract. Job losses, lower housing wealth, and tight credit conditions have weighed on consumer sentiment and spending. Weak sales prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories and fixed investment. Although the economic outlook has improved modestly since the March meeting, partly reflecting some easing of financial market conditions, the Committee anticipates that economic activity will continue to contract in the near term and that the subsequent recovery could be sluggish. In light of increasing economic slack here and abroad, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued. Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that are most consistent with sustainable economic growth and price stability in the longer term. In these circumstances, the Committee has decided to provide additional monetary stimulus by stepping up its purchases of longer-term securities. To improve conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve has recently begun purchasing longer-term Treasury securities, and the Committee now intends to acquire up to $750 billion of these securities by year-end. The Committee continues to anticipate that the Federal Reserve will purchase up to $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt over the course of this year. The Committee is prepared to make further adjustments to the timing and overall amounts of these purchases of Treasury, agency, and mortgage-backed securities as appropriate in view of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.

Household spending appears to be expanding, but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending is being damped by firms' efforts to reduce inventories to bring them into better alignment with sales and by cutbacks in fixed investment. Partly reflecting these factors, the Committee anticipates that the economic recovery will be relatively weak and that slack in resource utilization will diminish quite slowly absent further policy action. Inflation has fallen considerably over the past year. With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time. To promote a sustained economic recovery and higher resource utilization, the Committee will provide additional monetary stimulus by increasing its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities to a total of $1.5 trillion, up from the previously announced amount of $1.25 trillion, and it is also in the process of purchasing up to $200 billion of agency debt. The Committee will extend these purchases through the second quarter of 2010 and gradually slow their pace in order to promote a smooth transition in markets.

4/28/10,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the labor market is improving. Though investment in nonresidential structures is declining, housing starts have edged up, growth in household spending has increased, and business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly. While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions have become more supportive of economic growth. With economic recovery under way, the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization. Although energy prices have risen on balance in recent months, inflation has remained subdued. The Committee will adjust the stance of monetary policy as necessary over time to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored and that inflation outcomes are consistent with price stability. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and now anticipates that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. The Committee will maintain its approach of not reinvesting the proceeds of maturing agency debt and payments on mortgage-backed securities held by the System Open Market Account. In addition, on May 3 the Committee will stop reinvesting the proceeds of maturing Treasury securities. To further reduce the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, and to return the balance sheet to a more normal composition, the Committee anticipates that it will soon begin gradual sales of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. The timing and pace of such sales will depend on evolving economic and financial conditions.

6/23/10,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that economic activity has continued to strengthen gradually and that the labor market is improving slowly. Household spending is increasing but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software appears to be rising at a robust pace; however, investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. Housing starts remain at a depressed level. Financial conditions have become less supportive of economic growth on balance, largely reflecting developments abroad, and bank lending continues to contract. Although the Committee still anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, the near-term outlook for economic activity has weakened somewhat. Prices of energy and other commodities have declined somewhat in recent months, and underlying inflation has trended lower. With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be quite subdued for some time, remaining below rates that would be consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, will warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. The Committee expects to maintain the current range for the federal funds rate until resource utilization and underlying inflation are clearly moving toward rates consistent with the dual mandate. In addition, to provide continued support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to aid overall conditions in private credit markets, the Committee will maintain holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities in the System Open Market Account at approximately their current level rather than allowing them to run off. The Committee will also continue to roll over maturing Treasury securities.

8/10/10,"Information received over recent months has increasingly suggested that the recovery in economic activity and the labor market is proceeding at an unsatisfactory pace. Household spending is increasing only gradually and remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software is rising less rapidly than earlier in the year, and the contribution of inventory investment to growth is likely to wane. Investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak, and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. Housing starts remain at a depressed level. Financial conditions have become somewhat less supportive of economic growth in recent months, on balance, and bank lending has continued to contract. Although the Committee still anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, the near-term outlook for economic activity has weakened. Measures of underlying inflation have trended lower in recent quarters. With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that the Committee considers most consistent with its mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices. To support the economic recovery, the Committee decided to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to ⅛ percent. Consistent with this reduction, the Board of Governors cut the remuneration rates on required and excess reserve balances to 10 basis points effective with the reserve maintenance period beginning August 12. The Committee anticipates maintaining this range for the federal funds rate until resource utilization and underlying inflation have moved appreciably closer to levels consistent with its longer-term objectives. To provide additional support for the economic recovery, the Committee will maintain the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term securities at their current level by reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in Treasury securities.

8/9/11,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that economic growth has been modest of late. Also, recent indicators suggest that improvement in overall labor market conditions has slowed. The modest pace of the recovery appears to reflect in part factors that are proving to be temporary, including the damping effect of higher food and energy prices on consumer purchasing power and spending as well as supply chain disruptions associated with the tragic events in Japan. Business investment in equipment and software continues to expand despite these shocks. However, household spending has flattened out, investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector continues to be depressed. Inflation has picked up this year, as firms have faced cost pressures from higher prices for some commodities and imported goods. However, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects the pace of recovery to pick up over coming quarters and the unemployment rate to resume a gradual decline toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee anticipates that inflation will subside, over coming quarters, to levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate. However, the Committee sees the risks to the inflation outlook as tilted to the upside. The Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations. To help ensure that inflation in the medium run is at levels consistent with its dual mandate, and thereby support progress toward maximum employment, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions-including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run-are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.

9/21/11,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates that economic growth remains quite slow. Recent indicators point to continuing weakness in overall labor market conditions, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has been increasing at only a modest pace in recent months despite some recovery in sales of motor vehicles as supply-chain disruptions eased. Investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector remains depressed. However, business investment in equipment and software continues to expand. Inflation has moderated since earlier in the year as prices of energy and some commodities have declined from their peaks. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee judges that inflation of 2 percent as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures is most consistent, over the longer run, with the dual mandate. Whereas monetary policy can determine the longer-run inflation rate, monetary policy does not determine the longer-run equilibrium rate of unemployment, which depends on structural economic factors that may vary over time. Currently, the Committee projects that, in the absence of further shocks to the economy, the unemployment rate would converge over time to a level around 5 to 6 percent; this projection is subject to considerable uncertainty. The Committee continues to expect some pickup in the pace of recovery over coming quarters but anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only slowly toward its longer-run equilibrium level. Moreover, there are significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets. The Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate further. However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations. To promote a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate exceeds 7 percent, inflation is projected to remain at or below 21/2 percent in the medium term, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored at mandate-consistent levels. On the basis of currently available information, the Committee expects these conditions to prevail at least through 2014. In addition, the Committee decided to expand its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities by a further $1 trillion at a pace of $80 to $85 billion per month over the next 12 months. This program should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will regularly review the pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the purchase program in light of incoming information and will adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee will maintain its existing policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and will reinvest principal payments from its holdings of agency securities in longer-term Treasury securities.

12/13/11,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November suggests that the economy has been expanding modestly, while global growth appears to be slowing. Although indicators point to some improvement in overall labor market conditions, the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has continued to advance, but business fixed investment appears to be increasing less rapidly and the housing sector remains depressed. Inflation has moderated since earlier in the year, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, absent further policy action, the pace of economic growth would remain modest over coming quarters and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will would decline only very gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Moreover, the Committee anticipates that inflation would settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook, and the risks to the outlook for inflation also appear to be tilted to the downside. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee decided today to purchase a further $500 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities by the end of December 2012. In addition, the Committee intends to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September. The Committee is also maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. These programs should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, provide support to mortgage markets, and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate. The Committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee now anticipates that economic conditions- including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run-are likely to warrant this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate at least through the end of 2014. Specifically, given its anticipated path for monetary policy, the Committee currently projects that the unemployment rate will be roughly 7 percent and the inflation rate will be around 2 percent at the end of 2014.

In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. As rates of resource utilization rise toward levels consistent with maximum employment, the Committee eventually will need to make monetary policy less accommodative in order to ensure that the economy expands at a sustainable pace and to prevent inflation from persistently exceeding its longer-run objective. In determining the appropriate time to increase its target for the federal funds rate, the Committee will consider a range of factors, including actual and projected labor market conditions, the medium-term outlook for inflation, and the risks to the achievement of the Committee's objectives. The Committee also decided to continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in June and to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as necessary to promote maximum employment and price stability.",C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9/13/12,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months. Although employment has increased somewhat the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has continued to advance, but growth in business fixed investment appears to have slowed. The housing sector has shown some further signs of improvement, albeit from a depressed level. Inflation has been subdued, although the prices of some key commodities have increased recently. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, without further policy accommodation, economic growth likely would not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions. Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is close to 2 percent, the Committee decided today to begin a new asset-purchase program. Specifically, the Committee now intends to purchase [ $750 billion ] of longer-term Treasury securities and [ $500 billion ] of agency mortgage-backed securities by early 2014, a combined pace of about [ $75 ] billion per month. These increases in its securities holdings should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments and remains prepared to make adjustments as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability. This new asset-purchase program replaces the previously announced maturity extension program. In particular, the Committee is ending its sales of shorter-term Treasury securities and reinstituting its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the conclusion of this asset-purchase program. In particular, the Committee also decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015.",A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided today to begin a new asset-purchase program. Specifically, the Committee now intends to increase its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $45 billion per month and increase its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $30 billion per month. This new asset-purchase program replaces the previously announced maturity extension program. In particular, the Committee is ending its sales of shorter-term Treasury securities and reinstituting its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee will continue this new asset-purchase program until it has observed substantial ongoing improvement in labor market conditions, provided that the Committee projects that inflation over the medium term will be close to its 2 percent objective and longer-term inflation expectations remain stable. Given its current assessment of the economic outlook, the Committee anticipates that this program will continue at least through mid-2013. These increases in its securities holdings should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.

12/12/12,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months, apart from weather-related disruptions. Growth in employment has been slow, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has continued to advanced a bit more quickly, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed. The housing sector has shown some further signs of improvement, albeit from a depressed level. Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee's longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee remains concerned that, without further policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions. Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee agreed today to increase its purchases of additional agency mortgage-backed securities at to a pace of $50 billion per month beginning in January. The Committee also will purchase longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $50 billion per month after its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of Treasury securities is completed at the end of this year.

To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will increase the pace at which it purchases agency mortgage-backed securities to $45 billion per month, and longer-term Treasury securities to $55 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions will further increase the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities and should put additional downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 51/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.

Although some labor market indicators have shown further improvement, the unemployment rate remains elevated.

The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall, but a substantial tightening of financial conditions would pose a risk to the economic outlook. The Committee recognizes that the persistence of very low inflation could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that, with appropriate policy accommodation, inflation will move up to its 2 percent objective over the medium term, and possibly slightly higher for a time. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.

The Committee's decisions regarding asset purchases are not on a preset course and will continue to be contingent on the incoming data. Specifically, as the Chairman has outlined, if the economy evolves about as expected, the Committee anticipates moderating the pace of its securities purchases later this year, but continuing purchases until the unemployment rate is about 7 percent, economic growth is sufficient to support continuing solid job gains, and inflation is moving back toward its 2 percent longer-run goal. The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases as necessary to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and anticipates maintaining this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6 to 5 1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy after a threshold has been crossed, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.

7/31/13,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that economic activity expanded at a modest pace during the first half of the year. Labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has been strengthening, but mortgage rates have risen somewhat and fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. Partly reflecting transitory influences, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall. The Committee also anticipates that, with appropriate policy accommodation, inflation will move back toward its 2 percent objective over the medium term, but it will pay close attention to inflation developments. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee expects today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, including very low short-term interest rates and ongoing, substantial Federal Reserve holdings of longer-term securities, will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee continues to anticipate that the current exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 61/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.

In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 61/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee eventually decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach to achieving its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. In addition, because the headwinds that have been restraining the economic recovery will likely abate only gradually, the Committee anticipates that achieving and maintaining maximum employment and price stability will require a patient policy approach that keeps the target for the federal funds rate below its longer-run normal value for a considerable time.",B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions, the Committee decided to make modest downward adjustments in the pace of its of asset purchases. Beginning in November, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $30 billion per month rather than $40 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $35 billion per month rather than $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.

Inflation continues to run well below the Committee's longer-run objective, even though longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee continues to see modest downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market. The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it will monitor inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation is moving back toward its objective over the medium term. Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment since the inception of its current asset purchase program, the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions over that period as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy. However, the Committee judges that progress toward its objectives for the labor market and inflation is not yet sufficient to warrant reducing the pace of its purchases. Accordingly, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.

If inflation remains well contained when the unemployment threshold is reached, as the Committee expects, the Committee will consider a broad range of indicators of economic and financial conditions in determining how much longer to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate. Indicators relevant to a comprehensive assessment of labor market conditions include the level and growth of payroll employment, labor force participation, and measures of hiring and separation. The Committee expects to be patient in considering any increase in its target for the federal funds rate so long as inflation remains well behaved.

The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.

The Committee also reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 61/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. Information relevant to a comprehensive assessment of labor market conditions includes the level and growth of payroll employment, labor force participation rates, and measures of hiring and job separation. The Committee now anticipates, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at least until the unemployment rate declines below 6 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.

This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.

4/30/14,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that growth in economic activity is picking up as the effects of unusually severe winter weather and other transitory factors fade. Labor market indicators showed further improvement with payroll employment expanding at a solid pace. Household spending appears to be rising more quickly. Business fixed investment continues to advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced. The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully; however, the Committee continues to anticipate that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases. Beginning in May, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $15 billion per month rather than $25 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $20 billion per month rather than $30 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases further at future meetings. However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.

In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases. Beginning in October, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $5 billion per month rather than $10 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $10 billion per month rather than $15 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely end its current program of assets purchases at its next meeting. However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress-both realized and expected-toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.",B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If, once energy prices stabilize, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to remain below 2 percent, the Committee will take additional actions to foster a more rapid return of inflation to the 2 percent objective.

When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.

Market-based measures of inflation compensation declined further; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustment in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. While the Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor market as balanced, it is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation. Given the economic outlook, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.",B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1/27/16,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that labor market conditions improved further. Although economic growth slowed late last year, partly reflecting temporary factors, household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at moderate rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft. A range of recent labor market indicators, including strong job gains, points to some additional increase in utilization of labor resources. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.

The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. Given the economic outlook and the ongoing improvement in the labor market, and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic outcomes, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ½ to ¾ percent. Even after this increase in the target range, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.

Household spending has been increasing at a solid rate in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, business fixed investment and net exports have been soft. A range of recent indicators, including strong job gains, points to some additional strengthening of the labor market. Inflation picked up in recent months; however, it continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain near historically low levels; some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations declined further. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with appropriately accommodative monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. However, global economic and financial developments in recent months pose downside risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. In light of continued low readings from measures of longer-term inflation compensation and expectations, the Committee judges that the risks that inflation will fail to rise to 2 percent over the medium term have increased. Given the economic outlook and associated risks, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent. The Committee anticipates that it will not increase this target range until inflation moves closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis and the risks to the economic outlook are more closely balanced. When adjustments to the target range become appropriate, their timing and size will depend on the Committee’s assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.

7/27/16,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the labor market strengthened and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate rate. Job gains were strong in June following weak growth in May. On balance, payrolls and other labor market indicators point to some increase in labor utilization in recent months. Household spending has been growing strongly but business fixed investment and residential investment have been soft. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear to have diminished, but the Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.
